For years, several generations of students at the **Institute of Telecommunications - ITEL** faced a silent challenge: accessing and organizing past exam papers was always complicated, making studying more difficult and fragmented.

That's when @creativemode, a group of young ITEL students known for their creativity and disruptive spirit, decided to transform this reality. They realized that, with the right technology, it would be possible not only to organize the academic past but also to facilitate the future learning of subsequent generations at Wakanda University.

The result? An innovative system that centralizes exam papers, allows for exam simulations, and offers detailed performance analyses, an AI module that automates manual processes, and provides a range of convenient functionalities in this context. A tool that promises to make studying smarter, more efficient, and adapted to the needs of each student—transforming the way of learning at ITEL.

We are certain that the initiative to transform a "legacy of difficulties" into a tool for academic empowerment has a very strong impact.

**Made by students for students.**
